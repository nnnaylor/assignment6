Angular is used to help simplify development and testing of single-page applications.  Angular works by reading the HTML code first.  This code has additional tags than normal HTML, and these tags are directives for Angular.  These directives bind input and output sections of the page using JavaScript variables.\r\n\r\n## How To Use AngularJS to Retrieve and Display Data in a JSON Array ##\r\n\r\n### Step 1 ###\r\n\r\nThe first step when using angular is to make sure that you have all of the files, such as JQuery, Bootstrap, and of course AngularJS.  After those have been downloaded and put into a folder you will need to link them in your index file.\r\n\r\n![Connect JQuery, Bootstrap, and AngularJS](/images/ConnectJava.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Step 2 ###\r\n\r\nThe next step is to create an application using AngularJS.  You will need to create an \"app.js\" file.  Once this file is created you will then need to write the code to create the app.\r\n\r\n![Create App in app.js] (/images/CreateApp.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Step 3 ###\r\n\r\nAfter that is complete you need to connect the app to the webpage using the index file.  To do this you need to go to the html tag, and add the ng-app code to connect the two.\r\n\r\n![Connect App] (/images/htmlApp.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Step 4 ###\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to set up the controller so that you can fetch the data from the JSON file.  You need to create a variable that will hold the information from the file once the data has been retrieved.  Once this step is completed all we have left is to connect the controller to the body, and then display the information!\r\n\r\n![Create Controller] (/images/AppJs.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Step 5 ###\r\n\r\nNow that you have created the controller you need to connect it to your index page.  In order to this you need to add an ng-controller to the body tag.  This allows you to reference the controller that you have created in the app.js file.\r\n\r\n![Connect Controller] (/images/ConnectApp.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Step 6 ###\r\n\r\nOnce you have connected the controller to the html file the only thing left to do is display the contents of the JSON file.  In order to do this we use the ng-repeat function to cycle through all of the items in the array.\r\n\r\n![Display Data] (/images/ListItems.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd now all of the information that was stored in the array is now being displayed to your webpage!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
